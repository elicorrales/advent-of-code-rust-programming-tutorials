# Tutorials Inspired by Website: Advent Of Code (2021)

These video-based(youtube) tutorials attempt to choose something somewhat challenging but at the same time go at a slow pace and try to go over basics.  
<br/>
The approach is to:
- constantly ask "what, why, how"
- try the most minimalist code unless it doesn't make sense to
- use the "onion" - sometimes we go deep into one topic, and at other times it's very shallow but we cover various topics  
<br/>

## [Video: Rust: "Advent of Code 2021 Day 3 Binary Diagnostic" Part 1 Problem-Solving, Cmd-Line Args, Files, Match, Errors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlssSNQIH9E)  
In this Part 1 video, we set up our code to try to solve the [**Advent of Code: Day 3: Binary Diagnostic**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3) puzzle.  
Not wanting the video to be too long, we just set up to read command-line (the file path), open the file, and handle some file errors.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/advent-of-code-binary-diagnostic-num-1) is the code for Part 1.

## [Video: Rust: "Advent of Code 2021 Day 3 Binary Diagnostic" Part 2 Reading Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syhZ-3yPHdM)  
In this Part 2 video, we further set up our code to try to solve the [**Advent of Code: Day 3: Binary Diagnostic**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3) puzzle.  
Not wanting the video to be too long, we just read the file and do some basic processing of contents.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/advent-of-code-binary-diagnostic-num-2) is the code for Part 2.

## [Video: Rust: "Advent of Code 2021 Day 3 Binary Diagnostic" Part 3 Processing Binary String Inputs Line by Line, For Loops, Iterator, Enumerate, Tuple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mMUx065jkk)  
In this Part 3, we **(almost!)** complete the code to solve the [**Advent of Code: Day 3: Binary Diagnostic**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3) puzzle.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/advent-of-code-binary-diagnostic-num-3) is the code for Part 3.

## [Video: Rust: "Advent of Code 2021 Day 3 Binary Diagnostic" Part 4 Verify Inputs, Array of Counters, Conditional Dynamic Vector Initialization]()  
In this Part 4, we take a final look at solving the [**Advent of Code: Day 3: Binary Diagnostic**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3) puzzle.  
**Spoiler**: We do **NOT** fully complete the solution to the puzzle.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/advent-of-code-binary-diagnostic-num-4) is the code for Part 4.
