# Tutorials Inspired by Website: Advent Of Code (2021)

These video-based(youtube) tutorials attempt to choose something somewhat challenging but at the same time go at a slow pace and try to go over basics.  
<br/>
The approach is to:
- constantly ask "what, why, how"
- try the most minimalist code unless it doesn't make sense to
- use the "onion" - sometimes we go deep into one topic, and at other times it's very shallow but we cover various topics

## [Video: Rust: Problem-Solving, Cmd-Line Args, Files, Match, Errors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlssSNQIH9E)  
In this Part 1 video, we set up our code to try to solve the [**Advent of Code: Day 3: Binary Diagnostic**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3) puzzle.  
Not wanting the video to be too long, we just set up to read command-line (the file path), open the file, and handle some file errors.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/advent-of-code-binary-diagnostic-num-1) is the code for Part 1.
